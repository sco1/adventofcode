## What is Advent of Code?
Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

## What is this repository?
This repository contains my attempted solutions for each year's Advent of Code event. My go to language for solving each puzzle is Python, however I also enjoy using Advent of Code to explore other languages, such as MATLAB, Rust, Julia, [Lox](https://github.com/sco1/pylox), or Go.

In most cases the provided solutions represent a "first-thoughts" approach to the day's problem rather than the most efficient.

## Solution Progress
The table below is generated from data contained in each year's README.md file. The per-language summary is provided as (full solve, partial solve) pairs.
