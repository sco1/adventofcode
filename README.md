## What is Advent of Code?
[Advent of Code][1] is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

## What is this repository?
This repository contains my attempted solutions for each year's Advent of Code event. Time permitting, solutions will be written in Python and maybe [Lox](https://github.com/sco1/pylox), MATLAB, Rust, or Julia.

In most cases the provided solutions represent a "first-thoughts" approach to the day's problem rather than the most efficient.
