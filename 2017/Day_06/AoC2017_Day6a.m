% The reallocation routine operates in cycles. In each cycle, it finds the memory bank with the most
% blocks (ties won by the lowest-numbered memory bank) and redistributes those blocks among the
% banks. To do this, it removes all of the blocks from the selected bank, then moves to the next (by
% index) memory bank and inserts one of the blocks. It continues doing this until it runs out of
% blocks; if it reaches the last memory bank, it wraps around to the first one.
%
% The debugger would like to know how many redistributions can be done before a blocks-in-banks
% configuration is produced that has been seen before.
%
% For example, imagine a scenario with only four memory banks:
%
% The banks start with 0, 2, 7, and 0 blocks. The third bank has the most blocks, so it is chosen
% for redistribution.
%
% Starting with the next bank (the fourth bank) and then continuing to the first bank, the second
% bank, and so on, the 7 blocks are spread out over the memory banks. The fourth, first, and second
% banks get two blocks each, and the third bank gets one back. The final result looks like this: 2 4
% 1 2. Next, the second bank is chosen because it contains the most blocks (four). Because there are
% four memory banks, each gets one block. The result is: 3 1 2 3. Now, there is a tie between the
% first and fourth memory banks, both of which have three blocks. The first bank wins the tie, and
% its three blocks are distributed evenly over the other three banks, leaving it with none: 0 2 3 4.
%
% The fourth bank is chosen, and its four blocks are distributed such that each of the four banks
% receives one: 1 3 4 1. The third bank is chosen, and the same thing happens: 2 4 1 2. At this
% point, we've reached a state we've seen before: 2 4 1 2 was already seen. The infinite loop is
% detected after the fifth block redistribution cycle, and so the answer in this example is 5.
%
% Given the initial block counts in your puzzle input, how many redistribution cycles must be
% completed before a configuration is produced that has been seen before?
