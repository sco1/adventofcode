    The reallocation routine operates in cycles. In each cycle, it finds the 
    memory bank with the most blocks (ties won by the lowest-numbered memory 
    bank) and redistributes those blocks among the banks. To do this, it removes
    all of the blocks from the selected bank, then moves to the next (by index)
    memory bank and inserts one of the blocks. It continues doing this until it 
    runs out of blocks; if it reaches the last memory bank, it wraps around to 
    the first one.

    The debugger would like to know how many redistributions can be done before 
    a blocks-in-banks configuration is produced that has been seen before.

    For example, imagine a scenario with only four memory banks:

    The banks start with 0, 2, 7, and 0 blocks. The third bank has the most 
    blocks, so it is chosen for redistribution.
    Starting with the next bank (the fourth bank) and then continuing to the 
    first bank, the second bank, and so on, the 7 blocks are spread out over the
    memory banks. The fourth, first, and second banks get two blocks each, and 
    the third bank gets one back. The final result looks like this: 2 4 1 2.
    Next, the second bank is chosen because it contains the most blocks (four). 
    Because there are four memory banks, each gets one block. The result is: 
    3 1 2 3. Now, there is a tie between the first and fourth memory banks, both
    of which have three blocks. The first bank wins the tie, and its three 
    blocks are distributed evenly over the other three banks, leaving it with 
    none: 0 2 3 4. The fourth bank is chosen, and its four blocks are 
    distributed such that each of the four banks receives one: 1 3 4 1. The 
    third bank is chosen, and the same thing happens: 2 4 1 2. At this point, 
    we've reached a state we've seen before: 2 4 1 2 was already seen. The 
    infinite loop is detected after the fifth block redistribution cycle, and so
    the answer in this example is 5.

    Given the initial block counts in your puzzle input, how many redistribution
    cycles must be completed before a configuration is produced that has been 
    seen before?

    Out of curiosity, the debugger would also like to know the size of the loop:
